<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Man as individual and Man as citizen. Nor does the division of his discussion into the <em>Ethics</em> and the <em>Politics</em> rest upon any such distinction. The distinction implied is rather between two stages in the life of the civilised man—the stage of preparation for the full life of the adult citizen, and the stage of the actual exercise or enjoyment of citizenship. Hence the <em>Ethics</em>, where his attention is directed upon the formation of character, is largely and centrally a treatise on Moral Education. It discusses especially those admirable human qualities which fit a man for life in an organised civic community, which makes him “a good citizen,” and considers how they can be fostered or created and their opposites prevented.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This is the kernel of the <em>Ethics</em>, and all the rest is subordinate to this main interest and purpose. Yet “the rest” is not irrelevant; the whole situation in which character grows and operates is concretely conceived.</p></div> </div>
