<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>X</h5><p>Of Political Constitutions there are three kinds; and equal in number are the deflections from them, being, so to say, corruptions of them.</p><p>The former are Kingship, Aristocracy, and that which recognises the principle of wealth, which it seems appropriate to call Timocracy (I give to it the name of a political constitution because people commonly do so). Of these the best is Monarchy, and Timocracy the worst.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">II6ob] From Monarchy the deflection is Despotism; both being Monarchies but widely differing from each other; for the Despot looks to his own advantage, but the King to that of his subjects: for he is in fact no King who is not thoroughly independent and superior to the rest in all good things, and he that is this has no further wants: he will not then have to look to his own</p></div> </div>
