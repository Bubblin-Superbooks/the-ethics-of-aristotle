And how can it be a Generation? because, according to notions generally held, not _any_thing is generated from _any_thing, but a thing resolves itself into that out of which it was generated: whereas of that of which Pleasure is a Generation Pain is a Destruction.</p><p>Again, they say that Pain is a lack of something suitable to nature and Pleasure a supply of it.</p></div> </div>
