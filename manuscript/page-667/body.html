Solon says, “Call no man happy till he is dead.” He must mean either, The man when dead <em>is</em> happy (a), or, The man when dead <em>may be said to have been happy</em> (b). If the former, does he mean positive happiness (a)? or only freedom from unhappiness ([Greek: B])? <em>We</em> cannot allow (a), Men’s opinions disallow ([Greek: B]), We revert now to the consideration of (b).</p><p>P. 18, l. 36. The difficulty was raised by the clashing of a notion commonly held, and a fact universally experienced.

It is the notion which supports the definition, because we have therein based Happiness on the most abiding cause.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">P. 20, l. 12.
