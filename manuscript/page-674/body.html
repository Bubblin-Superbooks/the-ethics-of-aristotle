I have adopted this word from our old writers, because our word <em>act</em> is so commonly interchanged with <em>action</em>.

Again, the [Greek: praxis] may be <em>good</em> though the [Greek: pragma] be wrong, as if a man under erroneous impressions does what would have been right if his impressions had been true (subject of course to the question how far he is guiltless of his original error), but in this case we could not call the [Greek: praxis] <em>right</em>. No repetition of [Greek: pragmata] goes to form a habit. See Bishop Butler on the Theory of Habits m the chapter on Moral Discipline, quoted above, sect. 11. â€œAnd in like manner</p></div> </div>
